   git clone <repo-url>
   cd online-shoes
```

2. If starting from scratch, init Vite:

   npm create vite@latest online-shoes -- --template react
   cd online-shoes
   npm install
   npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite  # tailwindcss installation
   ```

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. Visit [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your project.
3. Set:

   * Framework: `Vite`
   * Build Command: `npm run build`
   * Output Directory: `dist`

4. Add environment variables (if you add a backend or payment keys) in Vercel dashboard:

   * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY`, etc.

Vercel will detect and deploy. You can configure custom domains in Vercel settings.

## How to make self-made changes

### Adding new products

* Edit `src/data/products.js` and add new product objects. Provide `id`, `title`, `price`, `category`, `thumbnail`, `images[]`, `description`.

### Replace mock API with a real API

* Create a small Node/Express (or Next.js) backend that serves endpoints:

  * `GET /api/products` -> list
  * `GET /api/products/:id` -> details
* Replace direct imports with data fetching (e.g. `fetch('/api/products')`) in `Home` and `Product` pages.
